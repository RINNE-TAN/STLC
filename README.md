# STLC Type Soundness Proof in Coq

This repository contains a formal proof of the **type soundness** of the **Simply Typed Lambda Calculus (STLC)** using Coq. The proof demonstrates that well-typed terms satisfy **progress** (a term is either a value or can take a step) and **preservation** (evaluation preserves types).
